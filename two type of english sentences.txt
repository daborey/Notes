You're absolutely right.

 There are distinct ways we use language when discussing ourselves versus others.
Talking About Yourself

When you're sharing information about yourself, you typically use:

    First-person pronouns: I, me, my, mine, myself, we, us, our, ours, ourselves
    Personal anecdotes
    Subjective language

Example:

    I love to travel. My favorite destination is Italy because of its rich history and delicious food.

Talking About Someone Else

When discussing another person, you usually employ:

    Third-person pronouns: he, him, his, she, her, hers, it, its, they, them, their, theirs
    Objective language
    Reported speech (if you're relaying what someone said)

Example:

    She is a talented musician. She plays the piano beautifully.

Key Point: Perspective and Voice

The primary difference lies in the perspective and voice of the conversation. When talking about yourself, you're the focal point and the narrative is from your viewpoint. When discussing someone else, the focus shifts to that person, and you're the observer or reporter.

Would you like to explore specific examples or delve deeper into the nuances of language used in these situations?

I can also provide examples of how to transition smoothly between talking about yourself and others in a conversation.

When talking about yourself: Use "I," "me," "my," etc.Example: I love to eat pizza.

When talking about someone else: Use "he," "she," "they," "him," "her," "them," etc.Example: She likes to dance.
